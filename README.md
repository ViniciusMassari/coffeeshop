A mobile UI-only application for a coffee shop delivery experience built with **React Native** and **Expo**.  
This project focuses on **interface design, animations, and navigation**, without any backend or real ordering system.

The goal of this app is to simulate a modern coffee delivery interface, exploring smooth animations, styled components, and mobile-first UX patterns.

## ⚠️ Attention

This project was developed using **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)** in screen texts.  
Labels, and UI texts may be written in Portuguese.
